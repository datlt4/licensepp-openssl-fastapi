# Module for locating the Crypto++ encryption library.
#
# Customizable variables: CRYPTOPP_ROOT_DIR This variable points to the CryptoPP
# root directory. On Windows the library location typically will have to be
# provided explicitly using the -D command-line option. The directory should
# include the include/cryptopp, lib and/or bin sub-directories.
#
# Read-only variables: CRYPTOPP_FOUND Indicates whether the library has been
# found.
#
# CRYPTOPP_INCLUDE_DIRS Points to the CryptoPP include directory.
#
# CRYPTOPP_LIBRARIES Points to the CryptoPP libraries that should be passed to
# target_link_libararies.
